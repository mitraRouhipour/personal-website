                   My name is Mitra Rouhipour and I have a civil Engineering and MBA background. I worked as a civil engineer in my home country, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</a>. Because of my interest in the Leather Art, 
                   I had a small bussines for handmade leather craft. <br />
                   I really liked to design App and websites to promote my products and I did some research about available opportunities in this area. That was the reason that I moved to Canada and Selected Computer Sicence Program
                   to study at <a href="https://langara.ca/">Langara College</a>.<br />
                   During my education, I learned programming, algorithm and data structure, and web programming practically through implementing assignments and projects. Right now, I am the second year student in Computer and I looking for some opportunities to go for my Co-op.<br />
